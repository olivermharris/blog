title: About Me
---

I am a UK based Software Engineer with a focus of data analytics and software security. I like to utilise tools to create a better development ecosystem, linking together fleeting notes of information into greater complexity detail.

This blog is created using Obsidian.md which is both on PC and Mobile linked together through SyncThing which allows me to edit information on the move, while using a Symlink internal vault folder in my main Obsidian.md vault linked to a Quartz working directory to publish the vault on Github Pages using a Github Actions Workflow.

***Tl;Dr*** This personal vault is similar to a second brain, which can be expanded upon simultaneously from my PC or Mobile, this is then Sync'd together to keep it updated from whatever device I wish to access it, Private information is kept in this vaults Master vault, which adjacent to contains the necessary programs to compile the markdown files of this vault into a functioning online blog.
