title: About MMOs
---
One of my favourite Genres of Video Games is MMOs, the sense of community and purpose in an ever expanding world, improving my own character be them a priest, support or DPS. To strive within a Guild, Village or Corporation to a shared goal.

Some MMOs grow commitment, others create challenge and very few sow distrust and paranoia. But whatever an MMO does, you know that it will not be done alone.
